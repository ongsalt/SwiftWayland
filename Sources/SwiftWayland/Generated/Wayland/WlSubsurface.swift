/// Sub-Surface Interface To A Wl_Surface
/// 
/// An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which has been
/// made a sub-surface. A sub-surface has one parent surface. A
/// sub-surface's size and position are not limited to that of the parent.
/// Particularly, a sub-surface is not automatically clipped to its
/// parent's area.
/// A sub-surface becomes mapped, when a non-NULL wl_buffer is applied
/// and the parent surface is mapped. The order of which one happens
/// first is irrelevant. A sub-surface is hidden if the parent becomes
/// hidden, or if a NULL wl_buffer is applied. These rules apply
/// recursively through the tree of surfaces.
/// The behaviour of a wl_surface.commit request on a sub-surface
/// depends on the sub-surface's mode. The possible modes are
/// synchronized and desynchronized, see methods
/// wl_subsurface.set_sync and wl_subsurface.set_desync. Synchronized
/// mode caches the wl_surface state to be applied when the parent's
/// state gets applied, and desynchronized mode applies the pending
/// wl_surface state directly. A sub-surface is initially in the
/// synchronized mode.
/// Sub-surfaces also have another kind of state, which is managed by
/// wl_subsurface requests, as opposed to wl_surface requests. This
/// state includes the sub-surface position relative to the parent
/// surface (wl_subsurface.set_position), and the stacking order of
/// the parent and its sub-surfaces (wl_subsurface.place_above and
/// .place_below). This state is applied when the parent surface's
/// wl_surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-surface's mode.
/// As the exception, set_sync and set_desync are effective immediately.
/// The main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,
/// since it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.
/// Even if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as
/// in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in
/// synchronized mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the
/// tree of surfaces. This means, that one can set a sub-surface into
/// synchronized mode, and then assume that all its child and grand-child
/// sub-surfaces are synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.
/// Destroying a sub-surface takes effect immediately. If you need to
/// synchronize the removal of a sub-surface to the parent surface update,
/// unmap the sub-surface first by attaching a NULL wl_buffer, update parent,
/// and then destroy the sub-surface.
/// If the parent wl_surface object is destroyed, the sub-surface is
/// unmapped.
/// A sub-surface never has the keyboard focus of any seat.
/// The wl_surface.offset request is ignored: clients must use set_position
/// instead to move the sub-surface.
