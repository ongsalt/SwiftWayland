/// Crop And Scale Interface To A Wl_Surface
/// 
/// An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
/// client to specify the cropping and scaling of the surface
/// contents.
/// This interface works with two concepts: the source rectangle (src_x,
/// src_y, src_width, src_height), and the destination size (dst_width,
/// dst_height). The contents of the source rectangle are scaled to the
/// destination size, and content outside the source rectangle is ignored.
/// This state is double-buffered, see wl_surface.commit.
/// The two parts of crop and scale state are independent: the source
/// rectangle, and the destination size. Initially both are unset, that
/// is, no scaling is applied. The whole of the current wl_buffer is
/// used as the source, and the surface size is as defined in
/// wl_surface.attach.
/// If the destination size is set, it causes the surface size to become
/// dst_width, dst_height. The source (rectangle) is scaled to exactly
/// this size. This overrides whatever the attached wl_buffer size is,
/// unless the wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is NULL, the surface
/// has no content and therefore no size. Otherwise, the size is always
/// at least 1x1 in surface local coordinates.
/// If the source rectangle is set, it defines what area of the wl_buffer is
/// taken as the source. If the source rectangle is set and the destination
/// size is not set, then src_width and src_height must be integers, and the
/// surface size becomes the source rectangle size. This results in cropping
/// without scaling. If src_width or src_height are not integers and
/// destination size is not set, the bad_size protocol error is raised when
/// the surface state is applied.
/// The coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to
/// the surface-local coordinates happen in the following order:
/// 1. buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform)
/// 2. buffer_scale (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale)
/// 3. crop and scale (wp_viewport.set*)
/// This means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale
/// are given in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale,
/// i.e. in the coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates
/// if the crop and scale was not applied.
/// If src_x or src_y are negative, the bad_value protocol error is raised.
/// Otherwise, if the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of
/// the non-NULL wl_buffer, then the out_of_buffer protocol error is raised
/// when the surface state is applied. A NULL wl_buffer does not raise the
/// out_of_buffer error.
/// If the wl_surface associated with the wp_viewport is destroyed,
/// all wp_viewport requests except 'destroy' raise the protocol error
/// no_surface.
/// If the wp_viewport object is destroyed, the crop and scale
/// state is removed from the wl_surface. The change will be applied
/// on the next wl_surface.commit.
