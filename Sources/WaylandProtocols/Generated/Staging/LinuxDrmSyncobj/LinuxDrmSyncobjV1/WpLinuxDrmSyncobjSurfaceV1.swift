/// Per-Surface Explicit Synchronization
/// 
/// This object is an add-on interface for wl_surface to enable explicit
/// synchronization.
/// Each surface can be associated with only one object of this interface at
/// any time.
/// Explicit synchronization is guaranteed to be supported for buffers
/// created with any version of the linux-dmabuf protocol. Compositors are
/// free to support explicit synchronization for additional buffer types.
/// If at surface commit time the attached buffer does not support explicit
/// synchronization, an unsupported_buffer error is raised.
/// As long as the wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1 object is alive, the
/// compositor may ignore implicit synchronization for buffers attached and
/// committed to the wl_surface. The delivery of wl_buffer.release events
/// for buffers attached to the surface becomes undefined.
/// Clients must set both acquire and release points if and only if a
/// non-null buffer is attached in the same surface commit. See the
/// no_buffer, no_acquire_point and no_release_point protocol errors.
/// If at surface commit time the acquire and release DRM syncobj timelines
/// are identical, the acquire point value must be strictly less than the
/// release point value, or else the conflicting_points protocol error is
/// raised.
