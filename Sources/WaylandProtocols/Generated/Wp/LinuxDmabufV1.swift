/// Factory For Creating Dmabuf-Based Wl_Buffers
/// 
/// This interface offers ways to create generic dmabuf-based wl_buffers.
/// For more information about dmabuf, see:
/// https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/userspace-api/dma-buf-alloc-exchange.html
/// Clients can use the get_surface_feedback request to get dmabuf feedback
/// for a particular surface. If the client wants to retrieve feedback not
/// tied to a surface, they can use the get_default_feedback request.
/// The following are required from clients:
/// - Clients must ensure that either all data in the dma-buf is
/// coherent for all subsequent read access or that coherency is
/// correctly handled by the underlying kernel-side dma-buf
/// implementation.
/// - Don't make any more attachments after sending the buffer to the
/// compositor. Making more attachments later increases the risk of
/// the compositor not being able to use (re-import) an existing
/// dmabuf-based wl_buffer.
/// The underlying graphics stack must ensure the following:
/// - The dmabuf file descriptors relayed to the server will stay valid
/// for the whole lifetime of the wl_buffer. This means the server may
/// at any time use those fds to import the dmabuf into any kernel
/// sub-system that might accept it.
/// However, when the underlying graphics stack fails to deliver the
/// promise, because of e.g. a device hot-unplug which raises internal
/// errors, after the wl_buffer has been successfully created the
/// compositor must not raise protocol errors to the client when dmabuf
/// import later fails.
/// To create a wl_buffer from one or more dmabufs, a client creates a
/// zwp_linux_buffer_params_v1 object with a zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1.create_params
/// request. All planes required by the intended format are added with
/// the 'add' request. Finally, a 'create' or 'create_immed' request is
/// issued, which has the following outcome depending on the import success.
/// The 'create' request,
/// - on success, triggers a 'created' event which provides the final
/// wl_buffer to the client.
/// - on failure, triggers a 'failed' event to convey that the server
/// cannot use the dmabufs received from the client.
/// For the 'create_immed' request,
/// - on success, the server immediately imports the added dmabufs to
/// create a wl_buffer. No event is sent from the server in this case.
/// - on failure, the server can choose to either:
/// - terminate the client by raising a fatal error.
/// - mark the wl_buffer as failed, and send a 'failed' event to the
/// client. If the client uses a failed wl_buffer as an argument to any
/// request, the behaviour is compositor implementation-defined.
/// For all DRM formats and unless specified in another protocol extension,
/// pre-multiplied alpha is used for pixel values.
/// Unless specified otherwise in another protocol extension, implicit
/// synchronization is used. In other words, compositors and clients must
/// wait and signal fences implicitly passed via the DMA-BUF's reservation
/// mechanism.
