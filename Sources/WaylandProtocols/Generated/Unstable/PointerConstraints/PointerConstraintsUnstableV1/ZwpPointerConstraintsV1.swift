/// Constrain The Movement Of A Pointer
/// 
/// The global interface exposing pointer constraining functionality. It
/// exposes two requests: lock_pointer for locking the pointer to its
/// position, and confine_pointer for locking the pointer to a region.
/// The lock_pointer and confine_pointer requests create the objects
/// wp_locked_pointer and wp_confined_pointer respectively, and the client can
/// use these objects to interact with the lock.
/// For any surface, only one lock or confinement may be active across all
/// wl_pointer objects of the same seat. If a lock or confinement is requested
/// when another lock or confinement is active or requested on the same surface
/// and with any of the wl_pointer objects of the same seat, an
/// 'already_constrained' error will be raised.
