/// Displays A Single Surface Per Output
/// 
/// Displays a single surface per output.
/// This interface provides a mechanism for a single client to display
/// simple full-screen surfaces.  While there technically may be multiple
/// clients bound to this interface, only one of those clients should be
/// shown at a time.
/// To present a surface, the client uses either the present_surface or
/// present_surface_for_mode requests.  Presenting a surface takes effect
/// on the next wl_surface.commit.  See the individual requests for
/// details about scaling and mode switches.
/// The client can have at most one surface per output at any time.
/// Requesting a surface to be presented on an output that already has a
/// surface replaces the previously presented surface.  Presenting a null
/// surface removes its content and effectively disables the output.
/// Exactly what happens when an output is "disabled" is
/// compositor-specific.  The same surface may be presented on multiple
/// outputs simultaneously.
/// Once a surface is presented on an output, it stays on that output
/// until either the client removes it or the compositor destroys the
/// output.  This way, the client can update the output's contents by
/// simply attaching a new buffer.
/// Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
/// backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
/// may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
/// Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
/// the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
/// Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
/// version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
/// interface version number is reset.
